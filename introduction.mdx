## What's Pagable?

If you're a developer who loves coding in Python, but isn't quite familiar with Javascript or React, Pagable is built for you. It's here to make creating websites (pages) & APIs faster & more easily in Python.

The **key features** include:

- Page & module reloading
- Markdown as a page
- Simple Python API

## At a Glance

The Python API is really simple to understand. Take this as an example:

```python
# src/pages/index.py
from pagable import alert, html

async def handle():
    await alert("Welcome to Pagable!")

    return html.h1("Welcome!")
```
