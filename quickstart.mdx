## Install Pagable

You can install pagable via [PyPi](https://pypi.org) or [GitHub](https://github.com).

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion icon="cube" title="PyPi (pip)">

```shell
pip install -U pagable
```

    </Accordion>
    <Accordion icon="github" title="GitHub Repo">

```shell
git clone https://github.com/AWeirdScratcher/pagable
cd pagable
pip install .
```

    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Create Your App

Once Pagable is installed, you'll be able to use its CLI.

```shell
pagable new .
```

This command will create a new app in the current working directory (`cwd`), which is referred as the `.` (indicates "here" or "this dir").

Alternatively, you can create a new app in a specific directory, just change the dot to your desired location, and remember to `cd` (change directory).

Once your app is created, you'll notice a project structure like so:

```haskell
.
├── public/
│   └── ...
├── src/
│   ├── api/
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── pages/
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── scripts/
│   │   └── ...
│   └── styles/
│       └── ...
└── pagable.config.py
```
